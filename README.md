# Data Drift Analysis and Anomaly detection tools

### INTRODUCTION
In the repository are reported methodologies of Anomaly and Drift Detection univariate and multivariate, tested on two different Datasets: [KDDCUP99](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) and [Bike sharing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset).

##### KDDCUP99

A Dataset usually used as a benchmark in the task of anomaly detection contains information about computer characteristics for the discrimination of possible cyber attacks. A more accurate description can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/48446353_A_detailed_analysis_of_the_KDD_CUP_99_data_set).

##### BIKE DATASET

Datasets are usually used as baselines in regression and time series forecasting tasks. Contains geographic and meteorological information for the hourly forecast of the number of bikes rented. A more accurate description can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset).

### METHODOLOGY

- Univariate_  PSI, Test Kolmogorov-Smirnov
- Multivariate: PCA Reconstrucion, VAE Reconstruction, MC-Dropout
